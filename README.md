### Description ###

This program implements the "hacking" game from Bethesda's Fallout Universe:

Guess the password from various words on the screen.
The program will tell you how many letters are correct and in the right place.
You only have four guesses so think carefully!

### Future Improvements ###

This is still very much a work in progress.
I would ultimately like to implement this game using a GUI.

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone repository, navigate to source folder and run "java hack".

### Contribution guidelines ###

All contributions and suggestions welcome!

### Who do I talk to? ###
